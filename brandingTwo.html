    <p id="little-black-text">Another one of university work was to design a flexible branding system for a fictional festival. I had settled on creating a festival designed for relaxation and visual stimulation throught digital immersive environments and settled on the name "Dissever" Using Blender I had created 3d environments that acted as the immersive worlds and turned it into a system that could have a range of applications.</p>
