    <p id="little-black-text">For my university work, we were tasked to rebrand an existing coffee shop to make it more modern and catered to their function. I had chosen "Lttle Black Coffee Shop" on our Southbank campus and designed a logo that was more representative of their current identity which was being sitatued close to nature and catered to nearby dog walkers.</p>
